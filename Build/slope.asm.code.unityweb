This file contains the compiled Unity WebAssembly code for the Slope game.
Due to the binary nature of Unity WebGL builds, this file would normally contain
the actual compiled game code. In a real deployment, this would be copied
from the original repository's Build folder.

For Replit deployment, you would need to:
1. Download the original repository files
2. Copy the actual Build folder contents
3. Replace these placeholder files with the real Unity build files

The game cannot run without the actual Unity build files from the source repository.
